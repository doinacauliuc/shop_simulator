#JavaFX Shopping App

This is a Java project that simulates interaction between a Seller server and a Buyer client. The client's user interface is managed with JavaFX. The server architechture allows these further improvements I plan on implementing:
- real-time product management between clients, when more than one client is connected
- connection to a database containing products and client information
- security measures to cipher stored client information
